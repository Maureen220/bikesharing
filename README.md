# Bike Sharing Proposal for Des Moines

## ***Overview of Analysis:***
The purpose of this analysis was to gather and interpret data from the successful Citibike campaign in New York City and see how it could be expanded to Des Moines, Iowa. 

Here is the link to the presentation on Tableau: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16317388433290/NYCCitibike?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## ***Results:***

The following images were created to analyze the ridership data:
<br></br>

### Checkout Times for All Users: 
![citibike_01.png](Data/citibike_01.png)
<br>
Users typically spend less than one hour riding the bike, suggesting that they are only going a short distance. It would be more advantageous to target high-traffic areas for this reason.
<br></br>

### Checkout Times by Gender: 
![citibike_02.png](Data/citibike_02.png)
<br>
The most frequent riders by gender are males. However, even with their increase in rides, they are still typically riding under one hour.
<br></br>

### Trips by Weekday per Hour:
![citibike_03.png](Data/citibike_03.png)
<br>
Trip counts follow the 5-day work week trend. There's more traffic Monday-Friday at 6am - 9am and 5pm - 7pm. Saturday and Sunday see more traffic from 10am - 7pm. 
<br></br>

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per hour):

<br>
This graph follows the 5-day weekday trends that were reflected in the previous slide and also depicts the higher frequency in male riders.
<br></br>

### User Frequency by Gender and User Type:
![citibike_05.png](Data/citibike_05.png)
<br>
There are more subscription riders between males and females. The unknown gender could partially be due to first-time riders, which is why they are slightly more likely to not be a subscriber. 
<br></br>

### Top Starting Points: 
![citibike_06.png](Data/citibike_06.png)
<br>
Here, the data shows that there are more riders in the central city/downtown part of Manhattan. Riders often rely on alternative forms of transportation in the inner-city, so Citibike should focus a lot of its bike drop off locations in the central part of the city. 
<br></br>

### Top Ending Points:
![citibike_07.png](Data/citibike_07.png)
<br>
The ending points reflect the same trends as the starting points, showing that the majority of bike sharing customers are residents or tourists visiting the downtown area of the city.

### ***Summary:***
When comparing the two dynamics of New York City and Des Moines, there are a few factors that make them inherently different. New York City is notoriously difficult to find parking or to even own a car in general, so the overall population would seek alternative forms of travel, especially when commuting during rush hour. Whereas Des Moines is a much smaller city and has unique demands when it comes to transportation. 
Des Moines is more likely to have an increased use of shared bikes for tourism, instead of 9-5 commute, which means there should be a greater focus on points of interest for bike drop-off locations. The two cities share the similarity in that the central and downtown areas of the city would be the ideal focus for a bike sharing program. 
In addition to location, user type, and gender, the data could show how age could determine ridership frequency and length. This dataset could also give us a visualization of the frequency of use for individual bikes, which could help create a plan for maintenance and rotation.
